# Little-Alchemy
This is a fully graphical little alchemy clone built in C++ with SFML 2.5.1. (IN DEVELOPMENT)

# About the original
Little alchemy is a graphical puzzle-like game where you can create new elements, all the way up to 580. This game is really fun and you can
play it at https://littlealchemy.com/. I do not claim to be the creator of the game, and I am just creating a clone of the game.
There is also a Little Alchemy 2 version (https://littlealchemy2.com), which I am not using here, mainly because I have not played it. :)

# Why?
When you search github, you often see many little alchemy clones, but only 7 of them are in C++! Not to mention, they are nearly all textbased (as far as I know.) I am closing that gap with
SFML and C++.

# How (to run)?
To run this code, you need SFML installed with C++ on your machine. I used hopson's tutorial on youtube here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcZFaiGFIMA to get it set up. Alternatively, you can use VS and simply use vcpkg and run the following commands:
~~~
  vcpkg install sfml
  vcpkg integrate
~~~

Please note that this is not a cureall solution and those commands might have to be modified. Eventually, when this project gets to beta or even release, there will be a precompiled binary with all the DLLs. For now, I have to assume that you compile it yourself.

# I don't like your code. How can I fix it?
Well, you are able to contribute with a pull request. You can also open an issue, and I will try to fix it as soon as possible.
