# Little-Alchemy
This is a fully graphical little alchemy clone built in C++ with SFML 2.5.1. (IN DEVELOPMENT)
# About the original
Little alchemy is a graphical puzzle-like game where you can create new elements, all the way up to 580. This game is really fun and you can
play it at https://littlealchemy.com/. I do not claim to be the creator of the game, and I am just creating a clone of the game.
There is also a Little Alchemy 2 version (https://littlealchemy2.com), which I am not using here, mainly because I have not played it. :)

# Why?
When you search github, you often see many little alchemy clones, but only 7 of them are in C++! Not to mention, they are nearly all textbased (as far as I know.) I am closing that gap with
SFML and C++.
